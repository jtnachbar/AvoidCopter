# AvoidCopter
> Creating an autonomous quadcopter with machine learning.

This repository contains code and documentation for a quadcopter.
It is intended to provide a future [CHS Sigma lab](http://wiki.chssigma.com/index.php?title=Main_Page)
student with resources for making a quadcopter-based project.

## Background

In the fall of 2016, Jamie Nachbar, Stephen Newman, and Jonah Weissman started working on
the 2016 Technology & Robotics challenge of the Department of Education's
[SLIC](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/project-based-learning/slic/index.shtml).
The goal was to make a UAV that could autonomously navigate an obstacle course using
only optical cameras. After getting 2nd place for our proposal, we decided to make this
project our engineering capstone. For more information, see 
[our motivation](motivation/motivation.pdf) and [how we built it](how_we_built_it/How%20We%20Built%20It.pdf).
