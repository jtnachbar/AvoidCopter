# Autonomous flight with dronekit

[Dronekit](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/) is a python library for interfacing
with drones. They have [great documentation](http://python.dronekit.io/guide/quick_start.html).
We were able to run the "Hello Drone" script, but it sometimes takes a while (maybe 10 seconds)
to connect to the drone. Dronekit is very powerful, so it would be a great tool to use for
further attempts at automation.
